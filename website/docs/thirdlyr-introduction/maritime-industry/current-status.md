## Overview

The maritime industry is the foundation of global trade, responsible for moving over 80% of international goods. Despite its essential role, the industry faces persistent inefficiencies in cross-border payments, regulatory compliance, and trade documentation. These inefficiencies lead to delays, increased transaction costs, and financial risks. 

Many shipping companies, port authorities, and suppliers still rely on outdated financial systems and manual processes. Payments can take several days to clear, trade documents are difficult to verify, and regulatory compliance often involves tedious manual checks. As global trade expands, these challenges continue to create unnecessary friction in maritime transactions.

### Challenges in the Maritime Industry

One of the most pressing challenges is the slow and expensive nature of cross-border payments. International transactions can take three to five business days to process due to reliance on correspondent banks and legacy banking infrastructure. This creates delays in vessel clearance and supply chain operations, while foreign exchange fees further add to transaction costs. Although some fintech platforms offer faster alternatives, they often focus solely on payments without integrating trade documentation, leading to reconciliation issues.

Verifiable trade documentation is another significant pain point. Invoices, bills of lading, and customs declarations are often processed manually, increasing the risk of errors, fraud, and duplication. Many of these documents are stored in centralized databases, making verification cumbersome and time-consuming. As a result, trade partners often experience disputes over payment terms and document authenticity, delaying the entire trade cycle.

Regulatory compliance and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements further complicate maritime finance. Businesses operating in different jurisdictions must adhere to various anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions regulations, each with its own documentation standards. These compliance checks are largely manual, requiring significant time and resources. Delays caused by regulatory reviews can hold up transactions, while non-compliance can result in hefty fines or legal consequences.

The fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems exacerbates these inefficiencies. Shipping firms, port operators, and suppliers often use different financial platforms, making it difficult to reconcile invoices with payments. Foreign exchange conversions introduce hidden costs, and multiple intermediaries slow down settlements. These inefficiencies result in financial losses, with businesses often losing three to five percent of each transaction to excessive fees and delays.

The maritime industry is at a critical juncture where traditional processes are no longer sustainable. As global trade volumes increase and regulatory requirements become more complex, businesses need a more efficient and reliable financial system that integrates payments, documentation, and compliance in a seamless and transparent manner.
