title: thirdlyr Blockchain
---
The thirdlyr blockchain is developed as the next generation infrastructure for cross-border finance in maritime, a traditional industry. 

While thirdlyr uses emerging technology to power the infrastructure, it will aim to minimize exposure to the technology for its end users and ensure that there is seamless user experience. The goal is to establish a fully decentralized ecosystem that works like existing banking rails but at a fraction of the time and speed required to execute transations. By leveraging existing security features of Ethereum and transactional speedup by rollup technology, thirdlyr protects itself against hacks and other vulnerabilities.
