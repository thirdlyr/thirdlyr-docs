thirdlyr was developed as a maritime-first infrastructure for cross-border finance. With thirdlyr, we tap into the US$500M maritime finance industry without exposing end-users to crypto. 

Participants in the thirdlyr network can support thirdlyr by being node operators to secure the network and maintain data availability. thirdlyr is currently developed in-house by the dev team, leveraging Arbitrum technology.
