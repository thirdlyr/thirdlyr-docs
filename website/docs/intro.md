thirdlyr is a Layer 3 chain built on top of the Arbitrum stack, built for making money mobile across the globe and engineered to have permanently available data attestation and data storage for compliance.

More specifically, thirdlyr was developed as a maritime-first infrastructure for cross-border finance. With this, we are tapping into a US$500M maritime finance industry that is ripe for disruption.

Participants in the thirdlyr network can support thirdlyr by being node operators to secure the network and maintain data availability. thirdlyr is currently developed in-house by the dev team, leveraging Arbitrum technology.
