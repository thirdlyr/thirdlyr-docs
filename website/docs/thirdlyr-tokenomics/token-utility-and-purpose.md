## THIRD Token Overview

The **THIRD** token is the native utility token of **thirdlyr**, designed to power the network’s core functions and foster ecosystem growth. As an ERC-20 token, THIRD is fully transferable, enabling seamless integration with decentralized applications, wallets, and exchanges within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Key Utilities of THIRD

1. **Gas Fees:**  
   THIRD acts as the medium for paying transaction fees on thirdlyr. Every operation, from simple transfers to complex smart contract executions, requires a small amount of THIRD to process. This ensures the network remains secure and resistant to spam.

2. **Incentives for Operating Data Nodes:**  
   To maintain a robust and decentralized infrastructure, THIRD is used to reward node operators who contribute computing power, storage, and bandwidth to the network. These incentives encourage high uptime, data integrity, and reliable performance across the ecosystem.

3. **Governance (Future Feature):**  
   In the future, THIRD holders will play an active role in shaping the direction of thirdlyr through decentralized governance. Token holders will be able to propose and vote on key decisions, including protocol upgrades, ecosystem grants, and changes to economic parameters.  
   ⚠️ **Note:** Governance will not be implemented at TGE and will be introduced in a later phase of the roadmap.

Through these functions, THIRD is not just a transactional asset but the foundation of thirdlyr’s economic and governance systems, aligning incentives for all participants in the ecosystem.
