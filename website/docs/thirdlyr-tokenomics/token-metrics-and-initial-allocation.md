## Token Metrics
### Maximum Supply
The maximum number of tokens coded to exist in the lifetime of thirdlyr. The value of tokens that exist will not exceed this number.

In the case of THIRD, that number will be determined to be 1B tokens. 

### Total Supply
Total supply is the amount of tokens that have been created, unlocked, and is circulating. This excludes tokens that have been burned, i.e. removed from circulation.
